<h1>Nessus Vulnerability Scan</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of multiple Nessus Scans on my home network and understanding and resolving (if needed) vulnerabilities.
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b> (23H2)

<h2>Scans Executed</h2>

- <b>Host Discovery</b>

- <b>Advanced Scan</b>

Both of these scans were executed with a /24 range.

<h2>Scan Results and Conclusions</h2>

The scan results were 5 hosts with a total of 25 vulnerabilities with 89% being info, 8% Medium, and 3% Low severity. 

The first Medium level vulnerability was the following - 

<b>mDNS Detection (Remote Network)</b>

Severity: Medium

ID: 12218

Version: 1.27

Type: remote

Family: Service detection

Published: April 28, 2004

Modified: June 28, 2021

The vulnerability can allow anyone to uncover information such as OS type, Version type, hostname, and list of services running.

The solution I found for this was clicking the Windows start button, and then searching for Services. I then stopped the Bonjour service because that is what is using mDNS on Windows.

The next two Medium-level and Low-level vulnerabilities were the following -

<b>SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted</b> 

Severity: Medium

ID: 51192

Version: 1.19

Type: remote

Family: General

Published: December 15, 2010

Modified: April 27, 2020

<b>SSL Self-Signed Certificate</b>

Severity: Medium

ID: 57582

Version: 1.6

Type: remote

Family: General

Published: January 17, 2012

Modified: June 14, 2022

<b>SSL Certificate Chain Contains RSA Keys Less Than 2048 bits</b>

Severity: Low

ID: 69551

Version: 1.4

Type: remote

Family: General

Published: September 3, 2013

Modified: November 15, 2018

The solution for these vulnerabilities was to ignore it. My office router uses OpenWRT to provide me with a web interface to tweak router settings.

The last Medium-level vulnerability was the following - 

<b>mDNS Detection</b> 

Severity: Medium

ID: 12218

Version: 1.27

Type: remote

Family: Service detection

Published: April 28, 2004

Modified: June 28, 2021

The source for this vulnerability was the Apple TV so the solution to the first vulnerability with the same ID didn’t work for this one. So my solution for this vulnerability was to filter incoming traffic to UDP port 5353. I did this by going into the Control panel selecting Windows Firewall, then Advanced Settings, then Inbound Rules, then clicking on New Rule, then Custom Rule, and filling out the required Info. However this didn’t work, after doing more research I realized that this wasn’t necessarily an issue that needed to be solved but rather this mDNS detection was informational.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

The Nessus Vulnerability Scan project on my home network, conducted through Nessus Essentials on a Windows 11 environment yielded insightful results. I learned more about where to find services and conducting research to find solutions.
